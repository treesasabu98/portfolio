## Projects
**Experimental Evaluation on Latex DRC60 Modified Bituminous Concrete Wearing Course** [More details](/btech/bituminous-concrete.md)
- Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which traffic travels which is likely to undergo early deterioration. This necessitates the need for frequent maintenance and there by increases the expenditure. Since the problem of deterioration is related to the properties of bituminous concrete mix, researches have been conducted to improve the properties of the mix using additives like nanomaterials, marble dust, latex etc. The objective of this study is to modify pure bitumen using latex DRC60 and evaluate the physical properties of the blend so as to determine its optimum content in bitumen. Further Marshall mix design was carried out for bituminous concrete layer using the modified latex bitumen blend at various binder contents. The specimens were tested for Marshall stability and flow values as well as the density and void calculations. The studies conducted showed that bitumen modified with latex DRC60 had better physical properties and the modified mix had better strength compared to that of conventional bitumen.
